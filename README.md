# FinStory Overview

**FinStory** is an AI-powered financial storytelling platform designed to simplify complex financial data. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), the project extracts key financial insights from company reports and transforms them into easy-to-understand narratives. The financial stories are then structured into a single JSON file, which serves as the final output for analysis and visualization.
